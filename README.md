This project uses the [Weather Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset) from Kaggle to perform image classification through transfer learning with VGG16 and ResNet50 models. It includes data augmentation, training, evaluation, and visualization tools to analyze model performance on weather-related images.
